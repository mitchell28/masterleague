# Master League Testing Framework

## Overview

This comprehensive testing framework has been created for the Master League football prediction application to handle advanced testing of data states, game transitions, and edge cases. The testing framework is built on top of Vitest with full database integration for thorough end-to-end testing.

## Test Infrastructure

### Database Setup

- **Test Database**: `test_masterleague` (PostgreSQL)
- **Isolation**: Each test runs in a clean database state
- **Schema**: Automatically synced with production schema via Drizzle ORM
- **Cleanup**: Automatic table truncation between tests

### Core Testing Files

#### `/src/test/database.ts`

- Database connection and setup utilities
- Test database initialization
- Table cleanup and reset functions
- Basic data seeding utilities

#### `/src/test/factories.ts`

- Comprehensive data factories for all entities
- User, Organization, Fixture, Prediction, Team factories
- Scenario-based data generation
- Randomized test data with realistic constraints

#### `/src/test/setup.ts`

- Global test configuration
- Environment setup for testing
- Database connection lifecycle management

## Test Suite Categories

### 1. Data State Management Tests (`data-states.test.ts`)

- **Fixture States**: Different fixture statuses (scheduled, live, finished, postponed)
- **User States**: User roles, verification states, ban status
- **Prediction States**: Prediction validation, timing constraints, locking logic
- **Organization States**: Organization structure and team relationships
- **Complex Scenarios**: Complete league scenarios with multiple interactions

### 2. Game State Transitions (`game-state-transitions.test.ts`)

- **Status Transitions**: Fixture state changes throughout match lifecycle
- **Score Updates**: Live score tracking and corrections
- **Prediction Locking**: Time-based prediction restrictions
- **Points Calculation**: Various scoring scenarios (exact scores, outcomes, draws)
- **Multiplier Effects**: Points multipliers for special fixtures

### 3. Advanced Edge Cases (`advanced-edge-cases.test.ts`)

- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple users acting simultaneously
- **Data Synchronization**: Race conditions and consistency checks
- **Error Handling**: Invalid data scenarios and recovery
- **Performance**: Large dataset handling and bulk operations

### 4. Leaderboard and Points (`leaderboard-points.test.ts`)

- **Points Calculation**: Exact scores (3 pts), correct outcomes (1 pt), incorrect (0 pts)
- **Points Multipliers**: Special fixture multiplier effects
- **League Table Management**: User rankings, statistics tracking
- **Leaderboard Rankings**: Sorting, tiebreakers, position calculation
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy rates, averages, relative performance
- **Multi-Organization**: Separate league tables per organization
- **Season Management**: Season-based league table separation

## Key Testing Features

### Factory Pattern Implementation

```typescript
// Example usage
const user = await UserFactory.create({ role: 'admin' });
const fixture = await FixtureFactory.createLive();
const prediction = await PredictionFactory.createCorrectPrediction();
```

### Comprehensive Scenarios

- Complete league setup with teams, fixtures, users, and predictions
- Multi-organization testing with different configurations
- Time-based testing for prediction deadlines and fixture scheduling
- Points calculation validation across different prediction types

### Database Integration

- Real database operations for authentic testing
- Foreign key constraint validation
- Transaction rollback testing
- Data consistency verification across related tables

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Passing Test Suites

1. **Basic Validation Tests**: 5/5 tests passing
2. **Setup Validation Tests**: 2/2 tests passing
3. **Data State Management**: 14/14 tests passing
4. **Game State Transitions**: 13/13 tests passing
5. **Leaderboard and Points**: 19/19 tests passing
6. **Advanced Edge Cases**: 12/14 tests passing (2 edge case failures in concurrent scenarios)

### Test Coverage Areas

- User authentication and authorization states
- Fixture lifecycle management
- Prediction timing and validation
- Points calculation algorithms (exact scores, outcomes, multipliers)
- League table management and rankings
- Leaderboard sorting and tiebreakers
- Performance metrics and accuracy calculations
- Organization and team management
- Data consistency across relationships
- Complex multi-user scenarios

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suite
pnpm test --run src/test/unit/data-states.test.ts
pnpm test --run src/test/unit/leaderboard-points.test.ts

# Run with verbose output
pnpm test --reporter=verbose

# Run basic validation tests
pnpm test --run src/test/unit/basic-validation.test.ts
```

## Database Setup Commands

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
brew services start postgresql@17

# Create test database
createdb test_masterleague

# Setup schema
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://billymitchell@localhost:5432/test_masterleague" pnpm drizzle-kit push
```

## Testing Philosophy

This testing framework follows these principles:

1. **Data-Driven Testing**: Real database operations with authentic data relationships
2. **State-Based Testing**: Comprehensive coverage of all application states
3. **Scenario Testing**: Complete user workflows from start to finish
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Unusual but possible scenarios that could break the application
5. **Performance Validation**: Ensuring the application works under load
6. **Consistency Checks**: Verifying data integrity across all operations

## Achievements

✅ **Auth Flow Fixes Completed**:

- Removed "welcome back" boxes from login/signup pages
- Simplified user flow to go directly to verify-email page

✅ **Advanced Testing Framework Delivered**:

- 65+ comprehensive tests covering all major application scenarios
- Full database integration with proper isolation
- Factory pattern for consistent test data generation
- Support for complex multi-user scenarios
- Real-time state transition testing
- Edge case coverage for production readiness
- **NEW: Comprehensive leaderboard and points testing**

✅ **Leaderboard and Points Testing Coverage**:

- Points calculation validation (exact scores, outcomes, draws)
- Points multiplier testing for special fixtures
- League table creation and management
- User ranking and position calculations
- Tiebreaker scenarios and sorting logic
- Performance metrics and accuracy calculations
